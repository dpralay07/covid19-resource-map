# covid19-resource-map
Link: https://hridaydutta123.github.io/covid19-resource-map/

A resource map during Covid 19 that might help everyone to locate nearby grocery shops, hospitals and gas stations with their opening time, closing time, phone number etc. It is a crowdsourcing platform where anyone can add new resource by clicking on the map and filling up the form on the marker popup. You can click on the existing markers to know about the resources already added on the map. You can click on search button and enter you location to point the map to the new location. Search location can be any state, city, street etc. 

This is a work in progress. Because there’s currently only myself working on this proejct, I’d really appreciate all the contributions.
